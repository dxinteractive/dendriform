## Development

This library is written and maintained by [Damien Clarke](https://damienclarke.me/), with feedback from others at [92green](https://github.com/92green). It was built to meet the data-requesting and caching needs of products at [Blueflag](https://blueflag.com.au/).
All online library discussion happens over on [Github](https://github.com/92green/dendriform).

I hope this library helps solve some data-editing user interface problems for you. ðŸŽ‰
